# 🛠️ EDA Toolkit (Legacy)

> This folder contains the predecessor to the `analyst_toolkit` project — a collection of early exploratory data analysis and cleaning utilities that laid the groundwork for more modular and scalable pipelines. While archived in favor of the newer system, it remains a valuable reference for understanding the evolution of this repository and for reviewers exploring its development history.
