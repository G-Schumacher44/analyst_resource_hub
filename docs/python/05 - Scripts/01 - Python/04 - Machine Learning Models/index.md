# 🐍 Python Script Resources

This section contains a library of starter scripts and boilerplate code for common data analysis, cleaning, EDA, and machine learning workflows. Each document is designed to be a self-contained reference for quick reuse and adaptation in your own projects.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*   [**EDA Templates**](02 - EDA/🐍 - EDA - eda_templates_v1.md): A comprehensive set of functions for initial data exploration, from summary statistics to core visualizations.
*   [**EDA Extras**](02 - EDA/🐍 - Eda Extras - eda_extras.py.md): Advanced and specialized visualizations like cluster maps, Andrews curves, and dendrograms for deeper insights.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

*   [**Quick Clean Statistics Runner**](03 - Cleaning/🐍 - Quick Clean Statistics Runner - quick_cleaning__stats_runner.py.md): A script to quickly generate key data quality metrics like missing values, skew, and outlier counts.

## 📈 Modeling & Diagnostics

*   [**Linear Modeling Extensions**](04 - Machine Learning Models/🐍 - Linear Modeling - linear_modeling_extentions.py.md): Runner functions for OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression models.
*   [**Logistic Modeling Extensions**](04 - Machine Learning Models/🐍 - Logistic Modeling -logistic_modeling_extentions.py.md): Runner functions for binary, multinomial, Poisson, and other logistic-family models.
*   [**Regression Model Diagnostics**](04 - Machine Learning Models/🐍 - Model Diag. - model_diag_regression.py.md): A suite of functions for post-hoc OLS model evaluation, including residual plots and statistical tests.
*   [**Logistic Model Diagnostics**](04 - Machine Learning Models/🐍 - Logistic Model Diagnostics - logistic_diag.py.md): Functions for evaluating classification models, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and calibration plots.
*   [**Tree and Boost Diagnostics**](04 - Machine Learning Models/🐍 Tree and Boost Diagnostics.md): Helper functions for extracting and tabulating results from `GridSearchCV` for tree-based models.

## 🛠️ Utilities

*   [**General Utilities**](05 - Utilities/🐍 - Utilities - utils.py.md): Core helper functions, including a simple train-test split and a VIF calculator.
