# ðŸ“‹ Supervised ML Decision Cards

This section provides decision cards to support the **selection, tuning, and evaluation** of supervised machine learning models.  
These resources are designed to help analysts and data scientists make informed choices based on dataset characteristics, project objectives, and trade-offs between interpretability, performance, and computational cost.  
The cards cover model family selection, algorithm comparison, and criteria for deciding when to choose simpler or more complex approaches.
