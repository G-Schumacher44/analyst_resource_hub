## 🎯 Purpose

Use this card to choose between a **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, or **Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost)** based on your modeling priorities — from interpretability to performance.

## 🌳 1. Model Comparison Overview

| Model             | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Decision Tree** | Single tree, easy to explain, fast but prone to overfitting                                |
| **Random Forest** | Many trees trained independently on bootstraps, reduces variance                           |
| **Boosted Trees** | Trees trained **sequentially** to correct prior errors, improves accuracy but more complex |

## ⚙️ 2. When to Use Which

| Use Case                                            | Best Model                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| You need interpretability and simple rules          | ✅ Decision Tree                           |
| You want strong generalization without much tuning  | ✅ Random Forest                           |
| You need top-tier performance and have time to tune | ✅ Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) |
| Data is very noisy or small                         | ❌ Avoid Boosted — can overfit             |

## 🧪 3. Performance / Training Tradeoffs

| Model         | Train Time | Predict Speed | Risk of Overfitting        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Decision Tree | ✅ Fast     | ✅ Fast        | 🔴 High                    |
| Random Forest | 🟡 Medium  | 🟡 Medium     | 🟢 Low                     |
| Boosted Trees | 🔴 Slow    | 🟡 Medium     | 🟡 Medium (tune carefully) |

## 📏 4. Interpretability

| Model         | Global Explanation          | Local Explanation           |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Decision Tree | ✅ ✅ ✅                       | ✅ ✅ ✅                       |
| Random Forest | 🟡 (via feature importance) | 🟡 (via SHAP/partial plots) |
| Boosted Trees | 🔴 (complex ensemble)       | 🟡 SHAP/ICE recommended     |

## ✅ Decision Checklist

* [ ] Accuracy or performance is top priority → Boosted Trees
* [ ] Interpretability is most important → Shallow Decision Tree
* [ ] You want a flexible, general-purpose ensemble → Random Forest
* [ ] Training time is limited → Avoid Boosted, use Tree or RF
* [ ] Will explain predictions with visuals (e.g., SHAP, ICE) → Prefer RF or Boosted with explainability tools

## 💡 Tip

> “Start with a tree. Grow a forest if you need stability. Boost it only when you’re chasing every drop of accuracy.”
