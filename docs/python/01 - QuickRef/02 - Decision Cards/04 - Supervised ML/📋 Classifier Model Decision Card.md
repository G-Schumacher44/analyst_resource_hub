## ⚙️ Step 1: Problem Characteristics

| Question                               | If Yes... | Then Consider...                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Is the target binary?                  | ✅         | Logistic Regression, NB, Tree      |
| Is the target multiclass (3+ classes)? | ✅         | Random Forest, Gradient Boosting   |
| Is class imbalance present?            | ✅         | Weighted Logistic, XGB, PR Curve   |
| Do you need model probabilities?       | ✅         | Calibrated Logistic, NB, XGB       |
| Is interpretability important?         | ✅         | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree |
| Is accuracy more important than speed? | ✅         | Random Forest, XGBoost             |
| Is the dataset large and noisy?        | ✅         | Gradient Boosting, RF              |
| Is data mostly text/categorical?       | ✅         | Naive Bayes, Tree-based models     |

## 🧠 Final Reminders

* 🎯 Start simple, baseline with Logistic or Naive Bayes.
* ⚖️ Tune thresholds and test with multiple metrics.
* 📉 Visuals improve communication — always include CM, ROC/PR.
* 🔍 Use SHAP for any ensemble or "black-box" model in production.

## 💡 Tip

> "When in doubt between multiple classifiers, run a quick cross-validation benchmark on a small feature set. This gives you a realistic comparison of accuracy, training time, and interpretability before committing to a model family."why
