## ⚙️ Step 1: Problem Characteristics

| Question                                             | If Yes... | Then Consider...                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Are clusters expected to be spherical/equally sized? | ✅         | K-Means, GMM                           |
| Is there significant noise or outliers?              | ✅         | DBSCAN, HDBSCAN                        |
| Do clusters vary in density or size?                 | ✅         | HDBSCAN, OPTICS                        |
| Should cluster shape be non-convex?                  | ✅         | Spectral, DBSCAN                       |
| Do you expect overlapping clusters?                  | ✅         | GMM (soft assignments)                 |
| Is interpretability or hierarchy required?           | ✅         | Hierarchical, Agglomerative Clustering |
| Is the dataset large (10k+ rows)?                    | ✅         | K-Means, MiniBatchKMeans               |
| Is the data mixed or categorical?                    | ✅         | K-Medoids, specialized encoders        |

## 📎 Step 4: Visual Aids for Stakeholders

| Goal                         | Visual                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Show cluster separation      | PCA / UMAP scatter with cluster color |
| Compare cluster quality      | Silhouette plot                       |
| Show feature patterns        | Heatmaps, radar plots                 |
| Show relative size           | Bar charts, pie charts                |
| Map clusters to known groups | Overlay plot or confusion matrix      |

## 🧠 Final Reminders

* There is **no one true clustering solution** — test multiple methods.
* Use both **quantitative metrics** and **domain insight** to validate clusters.
* Always include visual evidence when presenting clusters.

Use this decision card alongside the Clustering Evaluation Checklist and Visual Guide to support structured, flexible analysis.

## 💡 Tip

> "Before committing to a clustering algorithm, run a dimensionality reduction method like PCA or UMAP to visualize the data structure. This can reveal natural separations, noise patterns, or feature scaling issues that may influence which model performs best."
