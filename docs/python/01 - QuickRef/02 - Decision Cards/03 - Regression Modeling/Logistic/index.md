# Logistic Regression Decision Cards

Decision cards for logistic regression modeling choices.
# ðŸ“‹ Logistic Regression Decision Cards

This section contains decision cards to guide **key modeling choices** in logistic regression.  

These resources help analysts choose the right feature transformations, select the most appropriate model type, and determine optimal evaluation strategies for classification problems. They also cover special considerations such as proportional odds in ordinal logistic models and threshold tuning for probability-based decisions.

## Available Decision Cards
