## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

### Should You Transform a Feature?

âœ… Check these conditions:

| Symptom | Suggested Action |
|---------|------------------|
| Strong right-skew in a numeric predictor | Log-transform or Square Root the predictor |
| Predictor has strong non-linear relationship with log-odds | Try binning or adding polynomial features |
| Heavy-tailed distribution (extreme outliers) | Log-transform to compress outliers |
| Large scale differences across features | Standardize (Z-score) or Min-Max scale predictors |

---

## ðŸ§  Key Reminders

- Logistic regression needs **linear relationship between X and log-odds**, NOT X and Y directly.
- Target variable (Y) must stay binary (0 or 1) âž” **NEVER transform Y**.
- Always **check distribution plots** and **log-odds plots** if possible.

âœ… Transform messy predictors â€” NOT the binary outcome!

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

> "Before transforming, plot each predictor against the log-odds (or use partial residual plots) to verify non-linearity. This ensures you only transform variables that truly need it, preventing unnecessary complexity and preserving interpretability."
