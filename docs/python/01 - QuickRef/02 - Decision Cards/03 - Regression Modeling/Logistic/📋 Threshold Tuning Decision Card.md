## 🎯 Purpose

Use this card to determine whether your logistic regression model needs **threshold tuning** — and how to choose a better cutoff than the default 0.5.

---

## 🔍 1. Why Thresholds Matter

* By default, `predict_proba() > 0.5` → positive class
* But when classes are imbalanced or **costs are asymmetric**, you may want:

  * 0.3 (catch more positives → higher recall)
  * 0.7 (reduce false positives → higher precision)

---

## ⚖️ 2. When to Tune the Threshold

| Situation                              | Action                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Class imbalance present                | Tune — 0.5 may misclassify minority class |
| Precision vs Recall tradeoff required  | Tune to align with priority               |
| Stakeholders need risk tiers or scores | Tune thresholds for each tier             |
| F1 score weak even if accuracy is high | Tune to rebalance output                  |

---

## 🧪 3. How to Find the Best Threshold

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve

precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_proba)

# Find threshold where F1 is maximized
f1_scores = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
best_idx = f1_scores.argmax()
optimal_threshold = thresholds[best_idx]
```

✔️ Use this approach to optimize for F1, precision, or recall based on goal

## 🧭 4. Strategy by Business Goal

| Priority                                | Threshold Strategy               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Maximize recall (catch all positives)   | Lower threshold (e.g. 0.3–0.4)   |
| Maximize precision (avoid false alarms) | Raise threshold (e.g. 0.6–0.8)   |
| Balanced F1 or AUC                      | Optimize empirically from curves |
| Risk banding (low/med/high)             | Create multiple threshold bins   |

## ✅ Threshold Tuning Checklist

* [ ] Used `predict_proba()` instead of hard 0/1 prediction
* [ ] Target imbalance reviewed
* [ ] Optimal threshold selected based on metric (F1, recall, etc.)
* [ ] Stakeholders informed of threshold shift
* [ ] Model outputs mapped to final decision logic
