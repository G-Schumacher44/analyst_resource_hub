# ðŸ“‹ Linear Regression Decision Cards

This section contains decision cards that guide **key choices** when building and refining linear regression models.  

These resources help analysts evaluate model complexity, select appropriate transformation strategies, and balance model fit with interpretability using statistically sound methods.

## ðŸ“‚ Available Decision Cards

- [ðŸ“‹ AIC vs BIC Decision Card](ðŸ“‹%20AIC%20vs%20BIC%20Decision%20Card.md) â€” Understand when to prioritize Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) vs Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection.
- [ðŸ“‹ Linear Feature Transformation Trigger Card](ðŸ“‹%20Linear%20Feature%20Transformation%20Trigger%20Card.md) â€” Identify when feature transformations are necessary to meet model assumptions.
- [ðŸ“‹ Regularization Decision Card](ðŸ“‹%20Regularization%20Decision%20Card.md) â€” Choose between Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regularization techniques for improved generalization.
