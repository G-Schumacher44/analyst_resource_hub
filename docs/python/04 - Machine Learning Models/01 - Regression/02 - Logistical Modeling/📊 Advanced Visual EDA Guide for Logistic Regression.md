## 🎯 Purpose
This guide provides best practices for conducting **visual exploratory data analysis (EDA)** before fitting a **logistic regression** model. The goal is to understand variable relationships, class balance, separation, and possible violations of assumptions.

---

## 🔍 1. Class Balance Check

### 📊 Count Plot or Bar Chart
Shows the distribution of the binary target variable (e.g., 0 vs 1).

```python
sns.countplot(x="target", data=df)
```

**Why:**
- Identify class imbalance
- Important for model evaluation (e.g., precision vs. recall focus)

---

## 🧪 2. Continuous Predictor vs Binary Outcome

### 📈 Disc Plot (a.k.a. Strip/Swarm Plot)
Shows how a continuous variable relates to the binary target.

```python
sns.stripplot(x="feature", y="target", data=df, jitter=True, hue="target")
```

**Why:**
- Visualize **class separation**
- Detect non-linear patterns

### 📊 Box Plot / Violin Plot
Summarizes feature distributions per class.

```python
sns.boxplot(x="target", y="feature", data=df)
```

**Why:**
- Compare median, spread, and outliers
- Spot potential predictors with clear group separation

### 📌 Disc Plot vs Confusion Matrix
A disc plot provides a **feature-level preview** of separation before classification. A confusion matrix **summarizes final model performance**. Use both to:
- Anticipate separability before training
- Validate if visual trends translate into predictive accuracy

---

## 🧠 3. Feature Correlation (to Detect Multicollinearity)

### 🔗 Heatmap of Correlation Matrix

```python
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
```

**Why:**
- Detect **highly correlated predictors**
- Guide feature selection or regularization (Ridge, Lasso)

---

## 🌀 4. Relationships Among Features

### 📊 Pair Plot (for small feature sets)
Explore interactions between continuous predictors colored by class.

```python
sns.pairplot(df, hue="target")
```

**Why:**
- Understand interaction patterns
- See class clustering/separation

---

## 📐 5. Logistic Curve Fit (Optional Visual Check)
Fit a logistic curve between a single continuous predictor and the binary target.

```python
sns.regplot(x="feature", y="target", data=df, logistic=True)
```

**Why:**
- Assess linearity of the logit visually
- Detect saturation or threshold effects

## 📌 Summary Table

| Visualization       | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Count Plot          | Check class imbalance                     |
| Disc/Strip Plot     | See class separation by feature           |
| Box/Violin Plot     | Compare distributions between classes     |
| Correlation Heatmap | Detect multicollinearity                  |
| Pair Plot           | Explore predictor relationships and class overlap |
| Logistic Curve      | Visualize logit relationship to a feature |
| Disc Plot + Confusion Matrix | Compare predicted vs visual separability |

---

## ✅ Next Step
Once you complete visual EDA:
- Scale numeric features if needed
- Encode categorical variables
- Begin model building and check for assumptions (linearity of logit, multicollinearity)
