## 🎯 Purpose

This guide outlines advanced transformation strategies tailored to model assumptions, statistical structure, and production constraints. It builds on foundational transformations by introducing model-aware workflows for linearity, encoding, normalization, and target stability.

## 🧠 1. Model-Aware Transformation Strategy

| Model Type          | Transformation Priority                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| OLS / GLM           | Linearity in features, reduced skew      |
| Logistic Regression | Linear logit, interpretable effects      |
| Ridge/Lasso         | Standardized scale, no multicollinearity |
| Tree-Based Models   | Optional log/smooth, handle categories   |
| Distance-Based      | Strong normalization (e.g., KMeans, SVM) |

✔️ Tailor transformations to the model's **core assumptions** and **fit behavior**

---

## 📈 2. Logit and Linearization Prep

### 🔹 Log-Linear Relationships

```python
import numpy as np
df['log_income'] = np.log1p(df['income'])
```

✔️ Use log/sqrt/yeo-johnson when linearity is poor in scatterplots

### 🔹 Box-Tidwell Interaction (Logit Linearity)

```python
# test: X * log(X) → add to logistic formula
```

✔️ Indicates violation of logit linearity assumption

---

## 🧮 3. Polynomial and Interaction Terms

### 🔹 Polynomial Expansion

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
```

✔️ Consider centering before expanding to reduce VIF

### 🔹 Interaction Engineering

* Multiply important features (domain pairs)
* Use EDA to inform nonlinear relationships

---

## 🔁 4. Target Transformation (Regression)

| Problem             | Solution                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Skewed target (`y`) | Log or Yeo-Johnson                            |
| Heteroskedasticity  | Log-transform to stabilize noise              |
| Multimodal target   | Consider binning or modeling tails separately |

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer
pt = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson')
y_transformed = pt.fit_transform(y.values.reshape(-1, 1))
```

✔️ Track reversibility for downstream interpretation

---

## 📦 5. Advanced Encoding Strategies

| Encoding Type       | Use Case                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| One-Hot             | Small fixed vocab (nominal)        |
| Ordinal             | Ranked levels (risk tiers, survey) |
| Target/Impact       | High-cardinality categorical       |
| WOE (Logistic only) | Binary target predictive encoding  |

```python
# Target Encoding Example
grouped = df.groupby('category')['target'].mean()
df['encoded'] = df['category'].map(grouped)
```

✔️ Apply cross-validation during encoding to avoid leakage

---

## ⏱ 6. Temporal Feature Expansion

| Strategy               | Purpose                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lag Features           | Capture recent trends       |
| Rolling Averages       | Smooth volatility           |
| Expanding Windows      | Cumulative behavior         |
| Cyclical Decomposition | Hour, day, week via sin/cos |

```python
df['hour_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)
df['hour_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)
```

✔️ Validate timezone alignment and seasonal periodicity

---

## 🧪 7. Transformation Evaluation Tools

### 🔹 Skew Reduction

```python
from scipy.stats import skew
skew_before = skew(df['feature'])
skew_after = skew(np.log1p(df['feature']))
```

### 🔹 Normality Diagnostic

* QQ plots before/after transformation
* Histogram or KDE with `log1p`, `boxcox`, `yeo-johnson`

### 🔹 Multicollinearity Check

```python
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
```

✔️ Run VIF post-transformation to verify decorrelation

---

## 📋 Advanced Transformation Checklist

* [ ] Continuous features reviewed for skew and log-scale applicability
* [ ] Target variable normalized if appropriate (log, Box-Cox)
* [ ] Polynomial features added with centering or regularization
* [ ] Categorical encoding strategy documented and justified
* [ ] Temporal columns expanded (lags, cycles, rolling)
* [ ] Multicollinearity reviewed post-expansion (VIF)
* [ ] All transforms logged and reversible where needed

## 💡 Final Tip

> “Advanced transformations aren’t cosmetic — they let your model speak the language your data actually needs.”

Use before: model fitting, residual diagnostics, or feature importance interpretation.
