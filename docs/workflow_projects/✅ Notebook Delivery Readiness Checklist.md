## 🎯 Purpose

Use this checklist to prepare any notebook for **portfolio, stakeholder, or production use**. It ensures clarity, modularity, and polish across your code, outputs, and documentation.

---

## 📄 1. Notebook Structure

* [ ] Imports organized at top (standard + custom functions)
* [ ] Data loading section is self-contained (with clear path or notes)
* [ ] Notebook uses logical cell structure (Load → EDA → Clean → Model → Results)
* [ ] Markdown cells explain purpose of each phase
* [ ] Headers or comment blocks separate sections clearly

---

## 🧹 2. Code Cleanliness

* [ ] All hardcoded paths, keys, or credentials removed or abstracted
* [ ] Print/log clutter removed or moved to debug appendix
* [ ] No commented-out code chunks unless useful context
* [ ] No unused variables or dead cells

---

## 🧪 3. EDA & Assumptions

* [ ] Key distributions and value counts are visualized and/or summarized
* [ ] Missingness and outliers documented
* [ ] Target variable distribution checked and commented on
* [ ] Data assumptions matched to model choice (e.g., linearity, normality)

---

## 📊 4. Modeling + Evaluation

* [ ] Model choice justified in markdown or intro cell
* [ ] Evaluation metrics printed + visualized (confusion, AUC, RMSE, etc.)
* [ ] Model limitations or risks briefly noted
* [ ] If classification: threshold logic explained or explored

---

## 🧾 5. Documentation & Polish

* [ ] Title, author, date, and context included at top
* [ ] Summary cell near top with goal + outcome
* [ ] Final result summarized at end (graph/table/markdown)
* [ ] Links to supporting scripts, functions, or guides if needed

---

## ✅ Export-Ready Checks

* [ ] Cells run top-to-bottom with no errors
* [ ] Notebook exports cleanly as HTML or PDF (no broken charts or red cells)
* [ ] Large outputs hidden or summarized
* [ ] Optional: watermark, disclaimer, or contact line added

## 💡 Tip

> “Good notebooks answer questions. Great notebooks tell stories — clearly, modularly, and reproducibly.”
