## 🎯 Purpose

This guidebook provides a clean, repeatable folder + file architecture for professional data analytics projects. It is designed to support workflows in SQL, Python, notebooks, and dashboards with audit-ready organization and documentation.

## 🧱 1. Recommended Folder Structure

```
project_name/
├── 📁 data/                # Raw, cleaned, or synthetic datasets
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── interim/
│   └── final/
├── 📁 notebooks/           # EDA, modeling, delivery-ready notebooks
├── 📁 scripts/             # Modular Python, SQL, or ETL logic
├── 📁 outputs/             # Model predictions, plots, summary exports
├── 📁 reports/             # PDFs, slides, executive summaries
├── 📁 dashboard/           # Looker Studio links, JSON configs, embed notes
├── 📁 docs/                # Markdown docs, guidebooks, config guides
└── README.md              # Project overview and setup instructions
```

✔️ Add `.gitkeep` files or `.gitignore` rules to manage each folder

## 📊 2. Notebook Workflow Expectations

| Cell Group          | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Imports             | All packages, function definitions           |
| Load & Check        | Pull in data, show schema, quick null check  |
| EDA                 | Visuals, describe(), value\_counts()         |
| Cleaning            | Missing handling, re-encoding, outlier flags |
| Feature Engineering | New columns, transformations                 |
| Modeling            | Train/test split, metrics, model explanation |
| Reporting           | Plots, markdown summary, export/logging      |

## 🔁 3. SQL Integration Tips

* Store production queries in `/scripts/sql/`
* Use views or saved queries in BigQuery, referenced from Python
* Log assumptions in markdown or `.sql` doc headers

---

## 💾 4. Versioning & Exports

* Save `.csv`, `.pkl`, or `.json` into `/outputs/`
* Use `joblib`, `pickle`, or `feather` to preserve modeling objects
* Final dashboards or exports should be copied into `/reports/`

## 📁 5. README.md Template

```md
# 🗂️ Project: Churn Forecasting v1

## Overview
Predict user churn using event and usage logs from Jan–Mar 2024.

## Folder Guide
- `/data/raw/`: Original CSVs
- `/notebooks/`: One notebook per stage: EDA, modeling, presentation
- `/outputs/`: Cleaned datasets, predictions, plots

## Tools Used
- BigQuery, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Looker Studio

## 💡 Tip

> “A structured project isn’t just easier to share — it’s easier to revisit, debug, and scale.”
