## 🎯 Purpose

This guidebook outlines a modular, notebook-driven pipeline for regression and classification modeling in Python. It supports scikit-learn and statsmodels workflows, emphasizes clarity, testability, and includes checkpoint logic.

## 📊 1. Pipeline Overview

```
[ Phase 1: Import + Config ]
[ Phase 2: Load + Explore ]
[ Phase 3: Clean + Transform ]
[ Phase 4: Split + Model ]
[ Phase 5: Evaluate + Explain ]
[ Phase 6: Export + Save ]
```

## ⚙️ 2. Modeling Skeleton (Core Workflow)

```python
# Phase 1: Imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Phase 2: Load Data
df = pd.read_csv("cleaned_dataset.csv")

# Phase 3: Preprocessing
X = df.drop(columns=['target'])
y = df['target']

# Phase 4: Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)

# Phase 5: Model + Evaluate
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Phase 6: Export
pd.DataFrame({"y_true": y_test, "y_pred": y_pred}).to_csv("predictions.csv", index=False)
```

## 🔧 3. Optional Layers

| Add-on             | Module                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross-validation   | `cross_val_score`, `GridSearchCV`                     |
| Pipelines          | `Pipeline()` + `ColumnTransformer()` for scale/encode |
| Statsmodels        | Use `ols` or `glm` for parametric model summaries     |
| Feature Importance | `.coef_`, `.feature_importances_`, SHAP               |
| Export formats     | `joblib`, `pickle`, `.csv`, `.json`                   |

## 📁 4. Directory Expectations

| Folder        | Contents                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/data/`      | Cleaned inputs or feature-engineered sets |
| `/outputs/`   | Model predictions or coefficients         |
| `/models/`    | Pickled/scored models if applicable       |
| `/notebooks/` | Final delivery notebook                   |

## ✅ Modeling Checklist

* [ ] Clear definition of `X` and `y`
* [ ] Feature transformation applied after split (to avoid leakage)
* [ ] Evaluation printed and plotted
* [ ] Model exported or saved to `/outputs/`
* [ ] Modeling assumptions or limitations noted

## 💡 Tip

> “A great model isn't just accurate — it’s repeatable, modular, and easy to explain.”
