🎯 Purpose

Use this visual guide to understand, validate, and communicate results from **Multiclass (Nominal)** and **Ordinal** Logistic Regression models. Each plot helps assess model behavior, class probability structure, and assumption alignment.

---

## 1️⃣ Multiclass (Multinomial Logistic Regression)

### 📈 A. Class Probability Distributions

**What it shows:** Predicted probability for each class per observation

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
probs = model.predict_proba(X_test)
plt.plot(probs)
plt.title("Predicted Class Probabilities")
```

✔️ Helps detect low-confidence predictions or class overlap

---

### 📉 B. Softmax Score Trends

**What it shows:** Influence of features on class probability scores

```python
# Use partial dependence or coefficient plots per class
```

✔️ Visualizes how specific features shift class predictions

---

### 🗂 C. Confusion Matrix (Multiclass)

```python
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred)
```

✔️ Detects which classes are often confused

---

## 2️⃣ Ordinal Logistic Regression

### 📊 A. Predicted Score Distributions by Class

**What it shows:** Where the model places predicted scores relative to ordinal thresholds

```python
# After fitting ordinal model, visualize raw prediction scores by actual class
sns.violinplot(x=y_true, y=model.decision_function(X))
```

✔️ Look for monotonic separation between categories

---

### 📐 B. Threshold Cutoffs

**What it shows:** Estimated logit cut points between ordinal levels

```python
# Ordinal models like mord expose thresholds (intercepts)
print(model.intercept_)  # θ_j values
```

✔️ Check if spacing between cut points makes sense (e.g., large jump from ‘medium’ to ‘high’)

---

### 🧪 C. Proportional Odds Diagnostic (Optional)

**What it shows:** If slopes are consistent across class splits

* Fit parallel regressions across class thresholds
* Plot coefficients or marginal effects by threshold group

✔️ If slopes differ greatly, PO assumption may be violated

---

## ✅ Visual Interpretation Checklist

* [ ] Class probabilities or scores plotted
* [ ] Confusion matrix reviewed
* [ ] Thresholds and score separations visualized (ordinal only)
* [ ] Softmax/logit outputs mapped to interpretable odds
* [ ] Assumptions flagged visually if violated

## 💡 Tip

> “If your classes are confused or your thresholds overlap — it’s your visuals, not your coefficients, that will tell the truth.”
