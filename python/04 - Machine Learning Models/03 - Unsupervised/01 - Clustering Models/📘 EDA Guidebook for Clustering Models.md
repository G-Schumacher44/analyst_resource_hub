🎯 Purpose

This guide outlines how to explore and prepare unlabeled data for clustering. It focuses on understanding structure, distribution, feature behavior, and conditions that influence model choices such as K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, GMM, and hierarchical clustering.

## 🧠 1. Confirm Unsupervised Clustering Use Case

* [ ] ✅ No target/label column (unsupervised setting)
* [ ] ✅ Goal: segmentation, anomaly detection, or structure discovery
* [ ] ✅ Interpretability vs flexibility prioritized (e.g., centroid profiles vs irregular shapes)

---

## 📊 2. Shape & Structure of the Dataset

### 🔹 Dimensionality Check

```python
X.shape  # rows, features
```

✔️ Consider dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) when d > 10

### 🔹 Missingness Summary

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

✔️ Ensure consistent imputation or deletion strategy

---

## 📦 3. Feature Distribution & Skew

### 🔹 Histograms & KDEs

```python
sns.histplot(data=df, x='feature', kde=True)
```

✔️ Flag skewed variables for transformation
✔️ Right-skewed features may benefit from log scaling

### 🔹 Boxplots

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df.select_dtypes(include='number'))
```

✔️ Identify univariate outliers

---

## 🔁 4. Scaling & Normalization Prep

### 🔹 Scaling Check

```python
df.describe()  # compare mean, std, max across features
```

✔️ Normalize for KMeans, DBSCAN, GMM if using distance-based models
✔️ Tree-based distance methods (rare) may skip this step

### 🔹 Suggested Transformers

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
```

---

## 🧮 5. Correlation + Redundancy

### 🔹 Correlation Heatmap

```python
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), cmap='coolwarm', annot=False)
```

✔️ Identify strongly correlated pairs
✔️ Consider PCA or feature pruning if redundancy > 0.85

---

## 🔍 6. Outlier Detection (Pre-Clustering)

### 🔹 Z-Score or IQR-Based Filtering

```python
from scipy.stats import zscore
np.abs(zscore(df.select_dtypes(include='number'))) > 3
```

✔️ Remove/flag high outliers to avoid skewing cluster centers

### 🔹 Visual Outlier Inspection

* Boxplot
* PCA scatter with density shading

---

## 🌐 7. Dimensionality Reduction (for Visual Inspection)

### 🔹 PCA or UMAP for 2D Shape Review

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```

✔️ Plot with color coding to visually inspect for clusters
✔️ Compare structure across scaled vs unscaled data

---

## 📋 Analyst EDA Checklist for Clustering

* [ ] Dataset has no target label
* [ ] Numeric and categorical features separated and reviewed
* [ ] Distributions checked for skew, outliers, and scale variance
* [ ] Features scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
* [ ] Correlation heatmap used to identify redundancy
* [ ] PCA or UMAP previewed to inspect shape
* [ ] Feature ranges aligned (avoid dominance by one feature)
* [ ] Outlier strategy documented

---

## 💡 Final Tip

> “Clustering finds what you feed it — scale, shape, and outliers are just as important as data volume.”

Use this before: K-Means, DBSCAN, GMM, HDBSCAN, Spectral, or Hierarchical clustering.
