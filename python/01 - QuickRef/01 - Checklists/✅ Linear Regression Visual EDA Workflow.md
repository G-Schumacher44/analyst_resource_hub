___
## Step 1: Target and Feature Distribution
- [ ] Histogram + KDE
- [ ] Skewness / Kurtosis calculation

## Step 2: Baseline OLS Modeling
- [ ] Fit model and assess residual plots
- [ ] QQ plot for normality
- [ ] Residuals vs Fitted

## Step 3: Model Integrity Checks
- [ ] VIF for multicollinearity
- [ ] Influence plot / Cookâ€™s Distance
- [ ] Boxplot of residuals by group

## Step 4: Model Extensions
- [ ] Polynomial fit comparison
- [ ] Try RLM (Robust Linear Model)
- [ ] Apply Ridge / Lasso / Elastic Net

## Step 5: Model Selection
- [ ] Plot RMSE vs alpha or complexity
- [ ] AIC/BIC curve
- [ ] Residual comparison (train/test)

## Step 6: Final Summary & Visual Audit
- [ ] Screenshot diagnostic visuals
