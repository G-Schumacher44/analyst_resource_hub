🎯 Purpose

This QuickRef explains how to use the **Random Forest Classifier** — a powerful, ensemble-based method that reduces overfitting and improves predictive accuracy over single decision trees.

## 📦 1. When to Use

| Condition                                         | Use RF?                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| You want better generalization than a single tree | ✅ Yes                                     |
| Mixed data types or missing values                | ✅ Yes (robust)                            |
| Need feature importance estimates                 | ✅ Yes                                     |
| Must deploy simple/explainable model              | ❌ Use shallow tree or logistic regression |

## 🌲 2. Core Logic

* Builds **many randomized decision trees**
* Aggregates predictions via **majority vote** (classification)
* Reduces variance while preserving flexibility

---

## 🛠️ 3. Fitting in sklearn

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=None, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 🔧 4. Key Hyperparameters

| Param               | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `n_estimators`      | Number of trees in the forest                |
| `max_depth`         | Maximum depth of each tree                   |
| `max_features`      | Number of features considered per split      |
| `min_samples_split` | Min samples needed to split an internal node |
| `bootstrap`         | Whether trees are built on bootstrap samples |

---

## 📊 5. Feature Importance

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
importances = model.feature_importances_
plt.barh(X.columns, importances)
```

✔️ Use permutation importance or SHAP for deeper insight

## ⚠️ 6. Tips & Limitations

* Less interpretable than a single tree
* Slower to train & predict on large datasets
* Can overfit if trees are too deep or not enough data

---

## ✅ Checklist

* [ ] Class imbalance reviewed (consider `class_weight='balanced'`)
* [ ] `n_estimators` tuned for performance
* [ ] Tree depth + node size limited to prevent overfitting
* [ ] Feature importances visualized
* [ ] Cross-validated results confirmed

## 💡 Tip

> “Random forests don’t overfit easily — but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to noise.”
