## 🎯 Purpose

This guidebook focuses on optimizing BigQuery SQL for speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability. It includes best practices for partitioning, filtering, schema design, and usage control.

---

## 💰 1. BigQuery Cost Model

* **You are charged per query based on scanned bytes**
* ✅ Minimize scanned columns → avoid `SELECT *`
* ✅ Use preview tools to check query size before running

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM `project.dataset.table`
WHERE DATE(timestamp_col) = CURRENT_DATE()
```

---

## 📦 2. Partitioning Best Practices

| Type             | Use Case                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `DATE` partition | Time-series data (events, logs, sessions) |
| `INGESTION_TIME` | When no date field exists                 |
| `INTEGER RANGE`  | Bucketing IDs, static ranges              |

* Use `_PARTITIONTIME` for filtering:

```sql
WHERE _PARTITIONTIME >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
```

✔️ Always include partition filters to avoid scanning all partitions

---

## 🧱 3. Clustering

* Improves performance **after partitioning**
* Works best on fields with moderate-to-high cardinality (e.g., user\_id, device)

```sql
CREATE TABLE ...
PARTITION BY DATE(event_date)
CLUSTER BY user_id, event_type
```

✔️ Cluster on fields commonly used in filtering, joining, grouping

## 🔍 4. Query Structure Tips

| Strategy                 | Example                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Avoid `SELECT *`         | Select only needed fields                |
| Use CTEs                 | Break down logic for readability + reuse |
| Push filters early       | Apply WHERE before JOINs when possible   |
| Avoid CROSS JOINs        | Use JOIN ON keys instead                 |
| Limit data for debugging | Use `LIMIT 1000` + `WHERE` slices        |

## 🧪 5. Safe & Efficient Functions

```sql
-- Avoid crashes from bad casts
SELECT SAFE_CAST(amount AS FLOAT64)

-- Handle nulls gracefully
SELECT IFNULL(channel, 'unknown')
```

✔️ Use `SAFE_CAST`, `IFNULL`, `COALESCE` to avoid type errors

---

## 📊 6. Materialized Views & Temp Tables

* Use **materialized views** for pre-aggregated logic (cost-efficient)
* Use **temporary tables** for intermediate analysis

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_counts AS
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS events
FROM `project.dataset.events`
GROUP BY user_id;
```

---

## ✅ Optimization Checklist

* [ ] Columns scoped precisely — no `SELECT *`
* [ ] Partition filters applied (`_PARTITIONTIME`, `DATE(event_date)`)
* [ ] Clustering enabled for common filters or joins
* [ ] Temporary tables or CTEs used to structure logic
* [ ] Previewed query scan size before running (optional)
* [ ] SAFE functions used to prevent failures
