## 🤝 On Generative AI Use

Generative AI tools (Gemini 2.5-PRO, ChatGPT 4o - 4.1) were used throughout this project as part of an integrated workflow — supporting code generation, documentation refinement, and idea testing. These tools accelerated development, but the logic, structure, and documentation reflect intentional, human-led design. This repository reflects a collaborative process: where automation supports clarity, and iteration deepens understanding.
