🎯 Purpose

This guide builds on the core logistic regression modeling framework by exploring advanced techniques, diagnostics, extensions, and decision-making strategies for binary and multinomial classification. It is intended for analysts creating robust, interpretable, and production-ready logistic models.

## 🧠 1. Model Framing and Extensions

### 🔹 Model Variants

| Variant     | Use Case                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Binomial    | Standard binary classification |
| Multinomial | 3+ unordered classes           |
| Ordinal     | 3+ ordered classes             |
| Poisson/NB  | Count data (GLM extensions)    |

### 🔹 Assumption Awareness

* Linearity in the logit (continuous predictors)
* Independence of errors
* Low multicollinearity
* Large enough sample size for stable coefficients

---

## 🔍 2. Advanced Assumption Checks

### ✅ Linearity of the Logit (for continuous predictors)

* Binned plots of `X` vs log-odds
* Box-Tidwell test (for interaction with log(X))

### ✅ Multicollinearity

```python
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
```

* VIF > 5–10 = high correlation risk

### ✅ Goodness of Fit

* Hosmer-Lemeshow Test
* Pseudo R² (McFadden, Cox-Snell)

```python
1 - (model.llf / model.llnull)  # McFadden
```

---

## 📊 3. Coefficient Interpretation Tools

### 🔹 Odds Ratios and Confidence Intervals

```python
np.exp(model.params)            # Odds ratios
model.conf_int().apply(np.exp)  # CI for odds ratios
```

### 🔹 Feature Importance Plots

* Bar plots of odds ratios (log scale)
* SHAP or permutation importance (for nonlinear/logit stacking)

## 📈 4. Advanced Evaluation Metrics

| Metric       | Use When                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| F1 Score     | Imbalanced binary classes        |
| ROC AUC      | Binary ranking, threshold tuning |
| Log Loss     | Probabilistic accuracy           |
| Brier Score  | Calibration accuracy             |
| Precision\@k | Risk-sensitive cutoff ranking    |

### 🛠 Model Score Export Snippet

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, log_loss
```

---

## 🔁 5. Threshold Optimization

### Visualize Tradeoff:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
```

* Tune based on business need (e.g., FP cost vs FN risk)
* Use disc plot or PR-threshold plot to visualize options

### Custom Cutoff Strategy:

```python
y_pred_opt = (y_proba > 0.6).astype(int)
```

---

## 🧪 6. Residual & Influence Diagnostics (statsmodels only)

### 🔹 Standardized Residuals

* Check for outliers / misfit

### 🔹 Leverage vs Residual

* High leverage + high residual = problematic points

### 🔹 Cook’s Distance

* Influence measure for logistic models

```python
model.get_influence().cooks_distance[0]
```

---

## 🧭 7. Penalized Logistic Models

### 🔹 Regularization

| Method     | Use Case                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| L1 (Lasso) | Feature selection + sparse model |
| L2 (Ridge) | Shrinkage, prevent overfitting   |
| ElasticNet | Mix of L1 and L2 penalties       |

### 🔹 GridSearchCV for Tuning

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV
```

## 📋 8. Reporting Template Elements

| Field                   | Description                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Model Type              | Binary / Multinomial / Ordinal          |
| Fit Metrics             | AUC, F1, Log Loss, Accuracy             |
| Threshold Strategy      | Default or custom (tuned)               |
| Odds Ratios             | Converted from coefficients             |
| Calibration Diagnostics | Brier score, calibration curve          |
| Influence Check         | Cook’s Distance or leverage             |
| Notes / Caveats         | Class imbalance, misclassification risk |
