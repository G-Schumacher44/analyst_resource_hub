🎯 Purpose

This QuickRef walks you through the core logic, fitting workflow, parameter tuning, and interpretation of **Ridge Regression** — the go-to model when you want to shrink coefficients without dropping features.

## 📦 1. When to Use Ridge

| Scenario                  | Why Ridge Works                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| High multicollinearity    | Stabilizes estimates by shrinking correlated weights |
| Many weak predictors      | Reduces variance without removing them               |
| Overfitting with OLS      | Adds penalty to control complexity                   |
| All features need to stay | Unlike Lasso, it keeps all coefficients              |

## ⚙️ 2. How It Works

* Adds **L2 penalty** to loss function:

$$
\text{Loss} = RSS + \alpha \sum w_i^2
$$

* Penalizes large coefficients, encouraging smoother models

---

## 🛠️ 3. Fitting Ridge in sklearn

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Always scale features before fitting
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), Ridge(alpha=1.0))
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

✔️ Use `RidgeCV()` to cross-validate `alpha`

---

## 🔁 4. Tuning Alpha

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
alphas = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
model = RidgeCV(alphas=alphas, cv=5).fit(X, y)
```

| Alpha ↑ | Effect                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Low     | Behaves like OLS (minimal shrink) |
| High    | Stronger shrinkage, more bias     |

---

## 📊 5. Output Interpretation

| Coefficients        | Meaning                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Small but ≠ 0       | Feature retained but shrunken                 |
| Close to OLS        | If alpha is low                               |
| Still interpretable | Unlike PCA or regularization-based transforms |

✔️ Use R² / Adjusted R² / RMSE to evaluate fit

## ✅ Modeling Checklist

* [ ] All features scaled (standardized)
* [ ] Alpha selected via CV or tuning
* [ ] Coefficients interpreted in context of shrinkage
* [ ] Baseline OLS compared for performance gain
