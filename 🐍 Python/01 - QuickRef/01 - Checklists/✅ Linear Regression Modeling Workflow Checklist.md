___

## 🔍 Before Modeling
- [ ] Histogram + skew/kurtosis of outcome
- [ ] Scatterplots for linearity
- [ ] Checked collinearity (heatmap + VIF)
- [ ] Outlier/influence points assessed

## 🏗️ Build Model
- [ ] Fitted OLS with `statsmodels` or `sklearn`
- [ ] Examined residual plots (QQ, histogram, fitted vs residuals)
- [ ] Added polynomial or interaction terms if needed

## 🧪 Evaluate
- [ ] AIC/BIC for model selection
- [ ] Train/test RMSE comparison
- [ ] Considered Ridge/Lasso if overfitting/collinearity observed

## 🧰 Extensions
- [ ] Used robust regression if outliers impacted fit
- [ ] Interpreted coefficients and confidence intervals
