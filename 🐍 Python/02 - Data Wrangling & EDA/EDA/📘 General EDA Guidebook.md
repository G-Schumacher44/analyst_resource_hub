## üéØ Purpose
This guidebook extends your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills with advanced techniques to deepen your understanding of complex datasets. It focuses on practical methods to detect anomalies, understand feature interactions, and prepare data for sophisticated modeling.

---

## üîç 1. Deepen Data Understanding

### ‚úÖ Review Basic Checks
Start with a quick recap of dataset structure and quality:
```python
df.info()
df.describe(include='all')
df.isnull().sum()
```
Confirm data types, missing values, and summary stats before moving forward.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è 2. Feature Engineering & Transformation

### üîÑ Create New Features
Generate features that capture important patterns:
- Date/time components (year, month, day)
- Interaction terms (e.g., product of two variables)
- Aggregated features (group means, counts)

### üîß Transform Variables
Apply transformations to improve model performance:
```python
df['log_feature'] = np.log1p(df['feature'])
df['binned_feature'] = pd.qcut(df['feature'], q=4)
```

---

## üìä 3. Advanced Distribution & Relationship Checks

### Multivariate Relationships
Explore how variables interact beyond simple correlations:
```python
sns.pairplot(df, hue='target')
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
```
Look for nonlinear patterns and clusters.

### Feature Interactions
Use group statistics and pivot tables to understand combined effects:
```python
df.groupby(['cat1', 'cat2'])['num'].mean().unstack()
```

---

## üß™ 4. Detecting Anomalies & Outliers

### Practical Outlier Detection
- Use IQR or Z-score for initial checks.
- Apply Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor for complex patterns:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
iso = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)
df['anomaly'] = iso.fit_predict(df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]))
```
Flag and review outliers carefully before deciding on removal or correction.

### When to Use Advanced Methods
- Use Mahalanobis distance to detect multivariate outliers when variables are correlated.
- Isolation Forest works well on high-dimensional data without assuming distribution.

---

## üîÑ 5. Handling Missing Data

### Visualize Patterns
Identify missingness structure:
```python
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
```

### Imputation Strategies
- Simple: fill with mean, median, or mode.
- Advanced: use KNN or model-based imputations when missingness is non-random.

---

## üîÅ 6. Scaling, Encoding & Dimensionality Reduction

### Scaling
Standardize or normalize features when models are sensitive to scale:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]))
```

### Encoding
Convert categorical variables to numeric:
- One-hot encoding for nominal categories.
- Ordinal encoding for ordered categories.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Use PCA or t-SNE to simplify data and visualize patterns:
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
components = pca.fit_transform(df_scaled)
```
